GOAL: Try and normalize the data for the balls that were added after the fact.

The balls were added in October 22, 2013.

To normalize them, I will use the following formula:
    new_probability = (old_probability / number_of_balls_after_Oct22_2013) * number_of_occurances_of_all_balls

This would find the probability of the balls as if they would be if they were always in the dataset (estimated).

To implement this:
    - For each ball 57-75, find the probability using the usual method. Let's call this X.
    - Find the number of balls drawn on October 22, 2013 or later. Let's call this Y.
    - Divide X by Y. Let's call this Z.
    - Find the number of balls drawn in total for our dataset.
    - Multiple Z by this total.
    - This is the new probability for the new balls that estimates their probability if they were always part of the dataset.
