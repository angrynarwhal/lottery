# Update megamillions_from_apriori.py to account for the addition of balls 57-75 in 2013
# Looks like first occurrence of the new balls is 10/22/13
# new_date = '2013-10-22'
# draws = (count of total draws since 2002)
# draws_since_2013 = (count of total draws after balls were added)
# for i in range(57,76):
#   number_frequency[i] = (number_frequency[i] / (draws - draws_before_additions)) * draws
