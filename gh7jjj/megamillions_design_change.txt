Intent: 
Normalize the historical averages to account for the more recent introduction of balls 57-75.

Equation:
    normalized_probability = ((probability / numb_of_balls_2013-10-22) * total_num_of_balls)

Steps:
- Find probability of balls 57-75
- Find number of balls drawn 2013-10-22 or after
- Find number of total balls drawn
- Divide the probability by the number of balls drawn 2013-10-22 or after (Step1 / Step2)
- Multiply the result of the last step with the total number of balls drawn (Step4 * Step3)
- This result is the normalized probability of balls 57-75
