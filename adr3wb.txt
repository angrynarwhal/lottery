The change that I made to the file 'meggamillions-from-apriori.py' file was on line 31-32 where i declared a vaiable 'dtest' equal to the dat 10/28/2017 when 
the megamillions lottery reduced the number of balls in the lottery from 75 to 70. then I had an if statement check if the date data being passed was
greater to dtest. this insured that the output data of number frequency would be nomalized and relevant to recent years of the lottery.
