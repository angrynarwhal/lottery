not sure what "normalize the historical averages" means but here's my take

GOAL: Fix probabilities being skewed low for recently introduced megaballs

Plan: For "previous 1 year" powerball frequency is counted starting from previous 1 year (when all powerball numbers present)
1. "recent_number_frequency" : powerball number frequencies in the previous year
2. number_probabilities now calculates probability from "recent_number_frequency"'
