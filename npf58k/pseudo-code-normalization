To account for the newly used numbers 57-75, I would implemented a weighted average calculation within megamillions-from-apriori.py.

Here's a rough idea of how it would work:
- create a variable that defines the start date of when the 57-75 balls were introduced (we can call it 57_75_start_date to match the snake casing)
- calculate the normalized probabilities
    - make a dictionary to store the normalized probabilities for each number
    - balls 1-56's frequencies are calculated using the entire historical dataset
    - balls 57-75's frequencies are calculated based on draws that occured AFTER their introduction (the 57_75_start_date)
    - calculate the normalized probability for each number by just dividing its frequency by the TOTAL draws in the previous year (the value of total_draws_1_year)
- then just sort the normalized probabilities
