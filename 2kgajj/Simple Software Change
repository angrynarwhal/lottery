# - Normalize the historical averages to account for the more recent introduction of balls 57-75??
# - My Interpretation {
#     What comes to my mind is two different approaches:
#     -- 1: Compare the historical averages to the newer ones with balls 57-75 to find out what amount of weight or impact the new editions added.
#     -- 2: Reconstruct all of the old data to include the extra balls and compare the old averages with less balls to the reconstructed ones.
#     Use these averages to create new probabilites for the lotto
#    }
#  Functions:
#    function to remove data based on the ball number
#    funciton to add data based on ball number
#    funciton to compare data
#    funciton for probability
